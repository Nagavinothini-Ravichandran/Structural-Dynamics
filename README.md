# Structural Dynamics using MATLAB
A curated collection of straightforward MATLAB codes designed to assist in solving both fundamental and complex problems within the field of structural dynamics. It is designed for students, researchers, and engineers who seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of structural dynamics concepts while minimizing learning obstacles.

Each script is: (i) Self-descriptive — well-commented with clear explanations of the underlying theory, (ii) Modular — organized so you can adapt and extend the code for your applications, and (iii) Practical — includes examples covering a wide range of problems, from single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems to complex multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) and finite element models.

Topics to be covered: Free and forced vibration analysis, Modal analysis, Damping models, Time history and frequency domain analysis, Nonlinear structural dynamics, and Response spectrum methods

Goal: The objective is to develop a resource that is conducive to learning, reproducible, and oriented towards practical application, effectively bridging the divide between theoretical concepts and their computational implementation in the field of structural dynamics.
